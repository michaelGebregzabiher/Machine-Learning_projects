Note : a Machine learning Model passes through the following steps  
    1) Data preparation/preprocessing/Feature Engineering  
    2) Model Creation  
    3) Train/test/validate the Model  
    4) save the Model   
    5) turn the jupyter notebook to python script so that you can manage it easly  
    6) then split to training and predict  
    7) use Fastapi to serve that model as a webservice(Request and Response)  
    8) create a simple web app ping pong i.e you gonna create an end point using a function ping pong and then change it to webservice     
    9)
