Hallo World!  
Code space is launched on my computer!

Note : a Machine learning Model passes through the following steps  
    1) Data preparation/preprocessing/Feature Engineering  
    2) Model Creation  
    3) Train/test/validate the Model  
    4) save the Model   
    5) turn the jupyter notebook to python script so that you can manage it easly  
    6) then split to training and predict  
    7) use Fastapi to serve that model as a webservice(Request and Response)  
    8) create a simple web app ping pong i.e you gonna create an end point using a function ping pong and then change it to webservice     
    ========================basic request/response Webservice==========================
     app = FastAPI(title="Ping")  

        @app.get("/ping")
        def ping():
            return "pong"

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=9696) 
Explanation  
app = FastAPI(title="Ping")
Creates the FastAPI application object.

The title="Ping" is used in the autogenerated API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger UI).

@app.get("/ping")
def ping():
    return "pong"
@app.get("/ping") registers a GET endpoint at the path /ping.

When someone requests GET /ping, FastAPI calls ping().

The function returns the string "pong".

Since it’s a plain string, the response is text (not JSON). If you returned a dict, FastAPI would return JSON.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=9696)
The if __name__ == "__main__": guard means the server only starts when this file is run directly (e.g., python main.py), not when it’s imported elsewhere.

uvicorn.run(...) launches the Uvicorn ASGI server:

host="0.0.0.0" → listen on all network interfaces (so it’s reachable from outside the machine/container).

port=9696 → serves on port 9696.
